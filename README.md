Project: glad_AI_tors

For this project you need to have Pygame installed

glad_AI_tors is an AI vs AI game where 2 characters (AIs) run around the map avoiding traps/walls, looking for weapons, and shooting the weapons at the other AI until one of them loses all their Health Points. Provided in the code are different levels of AI. where trainer_cross, trainer_orbit, and trainer_tower are the simplest level AIs provided by the professor. The rest of the AIs difficulity goes up depending on the number found in their name. For example 2021_dev_tier_2_BRUCE would beat 2021_dev_tier_1_CRUDE more than 90% of the time, 2021_dev_tier_3_RICKY would beat 2021_dev_tier_2_BRUCE more than 90% of the time, so on and so forth. In this assignment, the AI I made is called Ameel. According to my testings, Ameel is around the level of 2021_dev_tier_7_JAMMY and 2021_dev_tier_8_BUNNY, going head to toe and beating them most of the time, while occassionally beating 2021_dev_tier_9_DEMON sometimes as well. 



The professor had actually made a tournament for all student made AIs to compete and from around 150+ students Ameel managed to climb up the ranks and make it to the 7th place. This is one of my most proudful programs created to date. 



To run this program first you can check where the file is located by simply running the any of the AI files. The first line is what you need, it should start with <<&>> and end with <<python.exe>>. Copy this line and then just add <<glad_AI_tors_v1.2.py>> after it, along with the 2 AIs that you want to make fight. 

As an example, the line that you should input into the terminal to run the program should look something like this:
	& C:/Users/g6you/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python39/python.exe glad_AI_tors_v1.2.py 2021_dev_tier_9_DEMON.py Ameel.py
